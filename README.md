## My process

 1. Analyze the structure of the project, before starting to code.
 
 2. Set HTML tags and integrate bootstrap for responsive design.
 
3. Create all styles and manipulate them with bootstrap (display, position, colors, buttons,etc)

4. Carry out the logic with javascript and implement the states for each input

5. Observe the behavior of the application to edit or change errors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Vanilla Javascript
- Sweet Alert2

### What I learned


Now I know more about the input element for html tags, I hadn't really validated forms before.
Validate inputs from user information.
Implement animated notifications

### Continued development

I'm making devs web with javascript to practice and develop my programming logic and web design, in addition to practicing the front-end knowledge.
